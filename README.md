# Emergency-Call
This project is created for the Call for Code 2020 Challenge to respond to the CODIV-19 pandemic

## Purpose and problem to solve
This project was created to solve the problem of the occupation of emergency numbers offered by the various states and to automate the withdrawal of a sick person from their home. 
In fact, as in many countries, every person who presumed to have been in contact with the virus called the emergency number occupying the emergency number lines. This meant that patients in a serious state of health had to wait long periods of time. This obviously forced the patient to be picked up by a family member from home and taken to the hospital, risking worsening the patient's state of health.
Furthermore, at the time of admission, it was discovered that many of these patients had pets, but that the patient, unable to communicate due to his health condition, was unable to communicate.
Thus Emergency-Call was born, the infrastructure designed not only to implement a faster emergency room, but also to protect our four-legged friends.
In fact, with the collection of the following data symptoms, contacts with people affected by the virus, pets and location, not only is it possible to collect patience faster, but it is also possible to send a veterinarian to take care of the animals when the patients have to be taken to the hospital.

## Idea
The idea is to create an application that can be simply downloaded from Google or Apple Store, so that it is freely accessible.

Instead, the Dashboard that reports all the information collected, should be distributed among all the health care centres and volunteers of the Red Cross to increase its performance effect on the collection of people.
In addition, all the information can be used to monitor the number of patients affected and with which symptoms, even for scientific research. It is also possible to implement an active geolocation so that the Red Cross volunteer can recognise through Live Geolocation if the patient is in the vicinity.
